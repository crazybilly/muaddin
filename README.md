# RStudio Addins for Millikin's ADC

An R package providing RStudio addins. Built primarily for use in Millikin's Alumni and Development Center.

## Available Addins

- Source with Beep - a function that mirrors RStudio's `source with echo()`, but beeps at the end (using beepr::beep() ), so you don't end up spending years on Facebook when you're waiting for a job to run.
